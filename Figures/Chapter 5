In here we have the figures that appear in Chapter 5.

We generate all the words of length k on an alphabet Sigma.

def binseq(k):  #constructing all possible words of length k on a given alphabet
    return [''.join(x) for x in itertools.product("".join(Sigma), repeat=k)]
    
We run exact_number_words(P,Simga,K) from Recurrence_Touzet_v1 for all the words of length k generated earlier with distance K=d.
This will give us the exact number of words in the neighbourhood for each word of length k.

We also run final_no_repeats(w,d,pre,Sigma,[],[]) from Generating_words_v2 on all words w of length k with distance d=K.
This will give us the number distinct words generated by the recurrences for the condensed-neighbourhood.

We then create box plots to display the results for each value of k, we make a grsph for each value of d=1,2,3.
