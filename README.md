# Final_Project_2017
On the maximum size of condensed sequences neighbourhoods under the Levenshtein distance.

This is the repository for the Project "On the maximum size of condensed sequences neighbourhoods under the Levenshtein distance", August 2017. It contains the implementations in Python of the recurrences of Gene Myers from "What's behind BLAST" as well as the implementation
for the paper "On the Levenshtein Automaton and the Size of the Neighbourhood of a Word" by Hélène Touzet.

We also include how to obtain the figures in the project.
